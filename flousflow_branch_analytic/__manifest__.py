Branch Analytic Accounting
==========================

Turn Odoo **Analytic Accounting** into a branch / profit-center tracking system.

Assign a single branch (analytic account) to a Point of Sale configuration, a
sales order or a customer invoice, and Odoo automatically posts the revenue and
the cost of goods sold (COGS) onto that same branch, so the Accounting -> Reports
analytic P&L shows Revenue - COGS = Gross Profit per branch.

Only P&L lines are tagged. Receivable, cash, bank, tax and stock-valuation
(balance-sheet) lines are never polluted.

Key features
============

* **Point of Sale** — new *Analytic Account* field on each POS configuration.
* **POS session closing** — sales, refunds, COGS and COGS reversals automatically
  receive the POS analytic account. Balance-sheet lines are left untouched.
* **Customer invoices & credit notes** — new *Analytic Account* header that is
  propagated to the invoice product lines (100%); native ``stock_account`` then
  copies it onto the COGS lines automatically. Credit notes reverse on the same
  branch.
* **POS-generated invoices** — inherit the analytic account from the POS
  configuration (header + lines), no manual selection required.
* **Sales orders** — new *Analytic Account* header that is propagated to the
  sale order lines, and from there natively to the invoice and COGS.
* **Optional enforcement** — require an analytic account before closing a POS
  session, posting a customer invoice, or confirming a sales order.

No core files are modified. Everything is done through standard inheritance and
native Odoo accounting / analytic / stock_account flows.

Configuration
=============

1. Create the branch analytic accounts (Accounting -> Configuration -> Analytic
   Accounts), optionally under a dedicated analytic plan.
2. Assign an analytic account on each Point of Sale configuration
   (Point of Sale -> Configuration -> Point of Sale -> *Analytic Accounting* tab).
3. Optionally enable the enforcement toggles in
   Settings -> Accounting -> *Analytics*.
